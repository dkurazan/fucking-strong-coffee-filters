Inspired by our first origin partners at the female-run Twongerekawa Coko Cooperative Society in the rolling hills of Rwanda, we're determined to share our beans and their story with anyone and everyone who likes good products made by good people.<br\/><br\/><strong>You can be a coffee nerd or novice and still agree on one thing: the grooviest of days starts with a Fucking Strong Coffee.<\/strong><\/p>",
